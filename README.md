## What is UF-Ex Engine?
UF-Ex, standing for UndyneFight-Ex, is a [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) based engine that uses the [MonoGame Framework](https://monogame.net/) to create Undertale styled rhythm games that was created by T-mas in 2020. The engine is used to create [Rhythm Recall](https://gamejolt.com/games/rhythmrecall/707354) and [OversaveTale Undyne Remake II](https://gamejolt.com/games/OSTundyneRemake2/655685).

## Why was this repository made?
The 0.2.2 version of the engine, along with the incomplete 0.2.2 version of Rhythm Recall, is currently [open sourced](https://github.com/Undertale-T-mas/UndyneFight-Ex-RE) and is **discontinued**. This repository is held by one of the original developers (TK), aiming to maintain and optimize the UF-Ex engine for public use and to further develop Rhythm Recall 0.3.0+.
